## Project Description

QR Shield is a Python-based GUI application that allows users to encrypt messages using Playfair or Hill (2x2) ciphers and generate QR codes for the encrypted messages. It also supports decrypting QR codes to retrieve the original message while preserving spaces, making it user-friendly for sharing and secure communication.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
